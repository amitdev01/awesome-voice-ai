**Description:** <h2>OpenAI Realtime API: Fast, Multimodal Speech-to-Speech for Developers</h2><p><strong>OpenAI’s Realtime API</strong> is a public beta API that enables developers to build fast, low-latency speech-to-speech experiences-similar to ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode-directly into their applications. Powered by the new <strong>GPT-4o</strong> model, it supports natural, expressive conversations with six preset voices and can handle both audio and text inputs and outputs.</p><p>Unlike previous approaches that required chaining separate ASR, LLM, and TTS models (often with lag and loss of expressiveness), the Realtime API streams audio in and out, allowing for natural, real-time conversations. The API can also handle interruptions smoothly, making interactions feel more human-like.</p><p><strong>Audio input and output</strong> are also being added to the Chat Completions API (as <code>gpt-4o-audio-preview</code>), supporting use cases that don’t require the ultra-low latency of the Realtime API.</p><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Low-latency
